/*===== test.html =====*/
1.	HTML tags are all in full caps

2.	DOCTYPE can be shortened to <!DOCTYPE html> fot HTML5 compatibility

3.	The value in the html tag's xmlns:fb parameter is already deprecated. New one is "http://ogp.me/ns/fb#"
	Personally, I would probably use the Javascript SDK instead of XFBML.

4.	The JQuery src is referencing a older version at Jquery's site.
	Better option would be to use the versions hosted on GoogleAPIs since alot of sites already do this and it would probably be cached on the user's browser already.

5.	Javascript comments don't start and end with <!-- & -->. Those are for HTML comments.

6.	.get is for getting DOM elements. The AJAX function should be:
	$.ajax({
		url: "./getinfo/111",
		cache: false
	}).done(function(data){
		$('.InfoDiv').html(data);
	});

7.	The Font tag is a relic from HTML4. CSS should be used to style the Header instead. For example:
	<h1 style="font-family:Verdana,Arial,Times New Roman; color:#00FF00;"></h1>

8.	The div with fb-root should be placed after the <body> tag so that the Javascript SDK loads as soon as the page loads.
	For that matter... where is the Javascript code for loading the SDK in the following script tag?

9.	the explode function should be used instead of 'split'. Split is the Javascript equivalent of PHP's expode.

10. $id = $ArrayURL[2]; //$ArrayURL[1] would simply return 'getinfo'

/*===== data.php =====*/
11.	my preferred code for establishing a database connection would be:
	$this->mysql = mysqli_connect("myhost","myuser","mypassw","mybd") or die("Failed to connect to MySQL: (".mysqli_connect_errno().")".mysqli_connect_error());
	Personally, I would close the connection as soon as I'm done with the querying so there aren't any idle DB connections.

12.	Perhaps the various get functions in propertyData should use a setter function to set the returned value to the variables.

13.	Also, is there REALLY a need to use objects for something like this?

/*===== data.sql =====*/
12.	Personally I would prefer to use varchar(255) for 'Title' instead of char(255)

13.	Condo table's PID should be a bigint.

14.	Will the database need to handle lots of transactions? Maybe changing the HDB and Condo table to MyISAM would be a good idea since it's faster.

15.	Personally, I would merge all 3 tables into 1.
	A little bit of repeated data is alright because atomic queries that are run on one table would be faster than having to do joins between three tables.
